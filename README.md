# Force Close

*This application was written in November of 2015*



Force Close is a Windows utility application written in Visual Basic with .NET Win-forms.

Force Close was created because some apps and games would become unresponsive and freeze the system, forcing the user to power down and restart their computer. Force Close allows the user to select the app by it's Window Title or Process Name, and add it onto a kill list. The user would then create a global hotkey combination of up to 4 keys using the Hotkey Creator. Afterwards, Force Close could then be minimized and placed in the background. Should the user encounter an unresponsive application, they can then press the hotkey combination they pre-configured and any application with a matching Window Title or Process Name would be killed.
